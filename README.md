- 👋 Hi, I’m @nikola-sv
- 👀 I’m interested in back-end systems, microcontrollers, helping artists navigate the digital world, simulations, data visualization, and hobbyist game development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, Python, and getting my Java skills into this decade.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I've never worked on a codebase with others.
- 📫 How to reach me: knoisv+wa@gmail.com, and I'll also be on Threads if they ever decide to respect user privacy.
